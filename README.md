## 🎯 Why It Matters
 
Poverty is not just a lack of income—it is a lack of access to opportunities. Many government and private-sector resources exist but are not reachable to those who need them most due to digital illiteracy, misinformation, or social exclusion. Rise Together solves this by:
 
- Simplifying access to verified opportunities.
- Creating a data-driven, skill-based growth pathway.
- Helping beneficiaries navigate and utilize government schemes effectively.
